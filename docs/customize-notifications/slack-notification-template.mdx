title: "Slack Notification Template"

You have the option to send custom templated messages to channels such as
BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab, and Slack.

Messages can include blocks such as the build speed chart, custom scripts,
layerfile statuses, links to preview environments, performance graphs for
individual pages, site performance graphs, regular text, etc.

To build your custom templated message, select the repository you wish to send a
message for on each commit, then select the "Notification Channel" dropdown in
the top-bar and build your template however you wish.

After you've built your template, head over to the "Settings" tab and select the
channel(s) that you want your template to be sent to.

Finally, click on the "Save" button in the top bar. Now, everytime you open a
commit, your templated message will be sent to the selected notification
channel(s)

## Control Slack Messages

To control what slack messages are send to the connected channel add a
`Skip remaining if` block to your template. The `Skip remaining if` block allows
you to specify a branch name and equality to determine whether or not to render
the rest of the message. If the statement is evaluated to be `TRUE` the remaining
blocks in the template will be skipped. If the `Skip remaining if` block is the
first block in the template the message will not be sent.
