## Setting up the Docker Application

**(You can skip this section if you already have an app with Docker running.)**

For this example we'll build an Express JS application that runs through Docker.

To build your Express application through Docker, ensure you have node, npm, and
Docker installed on your computer. You can verify if node, npm, and Docker are
installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

- `node --version`

- `npm --version`

- `docker`

If installed correctly these commands will all give you an output in the
terminal.

If `node` and `npm` are installed, create a new directory with
`mkdir [app_name]` - replacing `[app_name]` with the name of your application.
Next navigate into the directory with `cd [app_name]` and run the following
commands:

1.  `npm init`

2.  `npm install express`

After installing express, create a new file called `app.js` at the root of the
folder and use the following to set up an endpoint for your application:

```javascript app.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World");
});

app.get("/test", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Test Route!");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

After creating your `app.js` file, create another file called `Dockerfile` in
the root of your folder, and add the following contents:

```docker Dockerfile FROM node:12-alpine RUN apk add --no-cache python2 g++ make WORKDIR
/app COPY . . RUN npm install --production CMD ["node", "app.js"] EXPOSE 80
```


Once your dockerfile is created, you can use the following commands to run your Docker
app:

 1. `docker build -t image .`

 2. `docker run -d -p 80:80 image`

### Summary of Steps:

 1. `node --version`


 2. `npm --version`

 3. `mkdir [app_name]`

 4. `cd [app_name]`

 5. Create your `app.js` file with the content above

 6. Create your `Dockerfile` file with the content above

 7. `docker build -t image .`

 8. `docker run -d -p 80:80 image`

## Layerfile

Listed below is an example Layerfile for webapp.io which you can use to setup a
basic Express application deployed with Docker. We'll breakdown this Layerfile
in the section below for a set of detailed explanation on what each one of the
instructions do.

```docker Layerfile
FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04

RUN apt-get install curl apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common
RUN curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
RUN add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
RUN apt update
RUN apt-cache policy docker-ce
RUN apt install docker-ce

COPY . .

RUN docker build -t image .
RUN docker run -d -p 80:80 image

EXPOSE WEBSITE http://localhost:80
```

## Setting up the Layerfile

If you haven't already, please sign up to [webapp.io](/sign-up), and install
webapp.io onto your repository.

Let's breakdown each instruction in our Layerfile.

### 1: Set the Image

`FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04`

The `FROM` instruction tells webapp.io what base to use to run tests from. There can only
be one `FROM` line, and in this case we're using the `ubuntu:18.04` virtual
machine image.

If you're familiar with AWS Ec2 Instances, this is similar to creating a virtual
machine from the ubuntu 18.04 image.

### 2. Install Docker

`RUN apt-get install curl apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common`

`RUN curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -`

`RUN add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"`

`RUN apt update`

`RUN apt-cache policy docker-ce`

`RUN apt install docker-ce`

The `RUN` [instruction](../layerfile-reference/run) will run the given script,
and fails the Layerfile if the script fails. In this case, we're using the `RUN`
command to install the dependencies we need to build and run the Express
application in Docker.

In this case we're using the `RUN` instruction to download Docker.

### 3. Get Repository Files

`COPY . .`

The `COPY` [instruction](../layerfile-reference/copy) moves files from your
repository to the virtual machine. The Layerfile will pick up on the files in
the repository that you are making the commit for, and will copy those files
into the virtual machine so you can run you project.

### 4. Build the Docker image

`RUN docker build -t image .`

Similar to the `RUN` commands above, this will execute the given script
`docker build -t image .`, which will install build the Docker image for the
Express app.

### 5. Run the Docker image

`RUN docker run -d -p 80:80 image`

Similar to the `RUN` commands above, this will execute the given script
`docker run -d -p 80:80 image`, which will run the Docker image that was
previously built.

### 6. Expose Docker Port on the Virtual Machine

`EXPOSE WEBSITE http://localhost:80`

The `EXPOSE WEBSITE` [instruction](../layerfile-reference/expose-website)
creates a link to view the virtual machine at a specific port. We use
`EXPOSE WEBSITE` to expose the virtual machine on port 80 which is where the
Express application runs after running `ng serve`. We use `EXPOSE WEBSITE` here
so we can get a link to our Express app to share with stakeholders involved in
our projects.

## Adding the Layerfile

The last step in this process is to add the Layerfile to your repository. Simply
create a file called `Layerfile` (no file extension) in the root of your Express
application. If you haven't already, install webapp.io onto your repository
containing your Express app. Once done, simply create a commit and push your
Express app to the repository with the new Layerfile. Webapp.io will pick up on
the Layerfile and build your Express application according to the steps in your
Layerfile.
