## What is webapp.io?

Webapp.io is a Serverless VM platform.

We build VMs in *seconds* every time you push code to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

- Our VMs automatically hibernate when they aren't being used
- We let you duplicate VMs to make copies of your stack and run acceptance tests in parallel
- We take snapshots of the VM as it builds, so that future builds can entirely skip `docker pull` or `npm install`

### What happens when I sign up?

1. You'll install webapp.io onto a GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket repository
2. Our onboarding will guide you to build a [Layerfile](../layerfile-reference/intro) which defines your VM build
3. You commit your Layerfile, and we'll automatically build it into a VM every time you push a commit.


### What can serverless VMs be used for?

Our users primarily use serverless VMs for three things:

1. Preview environments - by making a Layerfile with the [EXPOSE WEBSITE](../layerfile-reference/expose-website) directive, you immediately get an environment deployed for every pull request.
2. Acceptance tests - by making a Layerfile with [SPLIT 5](../layerfile-reference/split), you can build your stack and fork it five times to run tests in parallel.
3. Hosting - by using [Prioritize Snapshot](../advanced-workflows/prioritize-snapshots), you can make ephemeral environments stick around and not shut off.

At webapp.io, we're building a *serverless VM platform*. You can even create multiple Layerfiles and combine them into powerful DevOps workflows to help your team ship 10x faster.

Screenshot after clicking on the button in GitHub to fork the repository.

### 2. Clone To Local

Clone the new Livechat Example repository to your local machine.

<img class="rounded" src="https://webapp.io/static/assets/clone-locally.png" />

Click on the "Code" button to get the URL to clone locally.

```bash Shell
git clone (INSERT URL HERE)
```

### 3. Sign up to webapp.io

[Sign up to webapp.io](https://webapp.io/sign-up) and install webapp.io on your GitHub account, **ensuring that webapp.io has access to the repository you created.**

### 4. Make a Local Change

Make a change to the project locally, and push your changes to the repository you created.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "making some change to Livechat example"
git push
```

### 5. View Website

Go to your dashboard on webapp.io to see your run, click on “Details”,“main-layerfile”, then “View website”.

<img class="rounded" src="https://webapp.io/static/assets/run-page.png" />

<img class="rounded" src="https://webapp.io/static/assets/detail-page.png" />

Click on "main-layerfile" here, followed by "View Website".

### 6. View Preview Environment

Wait for the server to start, you'll be redirected to a preview environment with the Livechat Example.

<img
  class="rounded"
  src="https://webapp.io/static/assets/livechat-example.png"
/>

That's all you need to view the full-stack preview environment with webapp.io!
Next, try making another change to one of the views (i.e., in
`/services/web/src/views/login/login.js`) and push a new commit to see another
preview environment with your changes.

## Quickstart

To view the power of preview environments in action, let's go through an example
with our open-source version of Slack,
[Livechat Example](https://github.com/webappio/livechat-example), that uses
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). For the purpose of this
quickstart guide, the codebase is monorepository, so all of the services are
within a single folder (/services).

Our Livechat Example contains the following within the `/services` folder:

- `/api` (our api to handle all requests)
- `/cypress` (for running tests)
- `/migrate` (for populating our database)
- `/web` (our React frontend)

Most importantly, in the root directory, we have our **Layerfile** which is a
**set of instructions that tells webapp.io how to install, build, and run** the
Livechat Example. This Layerfile for our Livechat example is shown below:

```docker Layerfile
FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04

# Install docker
RUN apt-get update && \
apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common && \
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add - && \
add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable" && \
apt-get update && \
apt install docker-ce

# Install docker-compose
RUN curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && \
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Copy repository files
COPY / /root

RUN /root/pull-images.sh
RUN REPEATABLE docker-compose build --parallel
RUN BACKGROUND docker-compose up

# EXPOSE WEBSITE creates an internet visible link
EXPOSE WEBSITE localhost:8000

```

## Limits

### General Limits

The following general limits are applied to all Webapp.io accounts to prevent
abuse.

## Snapshots & Snapshot Retention

A snapshot is a copy of a virtual machine at a specific moment in time. Snapshots help to load environments and configurations so that you can skip
running steps that have not changed or that have successfully executed on
previous commits.

### Algorithm for Deleting Snapshots

Listed below is a summary of how we delete snapshots. It's important to review
this to learn the states of snapshots at different times.

1. Split important snapshots into VIP, Important, and Not Important (VIP as the top tier).

Important Snapshots:

- Newer than 10 minutes
- Newer than a week old and the latest snapshot for an instruction
- Newer than a week old and contains the [EXPOSE WEBSITE](./layerfile-reference/expose-website) instruction for an open pull request.

VIP Snapshots:

- 30 prioritized snapshots per paying customer as determined by tier and how
  recent the snapshots are

2. Order Snapshot Importance (VIP, Important, Not Important)

3. Delete Snapshots

Delete Process:

- Delete the oldest not important
- Delete the oldest important
- Delete the oldest VIP

## Environmental Lifecycle

Environments (Layerfiles with [EXPOSE WEBSITE](./layerfile-reference/expose-website), Layerfiles that expose a debug terminal, etc.) have three lifecycle levels:

- _Deleted_, which means you can't start them without rebuilding (rebuilding deletes
  everything, like your temporary database, registered user, and state in the environment).
- _Stopped_, which means you see a spinner as they start - _Running_, which means
  it's currently running

### Running to Stopped

The Running lifecycle to Stopped lifecycle happens for a few reasons:

- After 3 minutes of inactivity if there are builds queued
- After 60 minutes in general (this can be changed by our admin team if
  requested)

### Stopped to Deleted

The Stopped lifectyle to Deleted lifecycle happens for two reasons:

- Something crashes (rare)
- Snapshot is deleted (see [Snapshots & Snapshot Retention](/introduction#snapshots-and-snapshot-retention)
