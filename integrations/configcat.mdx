# ConfigCat

[ConfigCat](https://configcat.com/) is a feature flag service for teams.

It allows you to enable/disable features remotely without redeploying code.

ConfigCat is cross-platform and works with your web, mobile, and server-side applications.

Key features include basic flags, targeting, %-based rollouts, variations, multiple environments, A/B testing, permissions, team management, SSO, 2FA, and SDKs for 10+ platforms.
