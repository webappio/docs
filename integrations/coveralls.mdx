# Coveralls

[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) is a hosted service designed to provide code coverage analytics.

Some key features include: repository coverage statistics, coverage reports, line-by-line coverage, repository overviews, coverage updates, and GitHub notices.

It's easy to get started with simple step-by-step instructions and built-in integrations with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
