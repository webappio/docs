# Sharing configuration across repositories: The webapp.io Library

`FROM` can inherit `Layerfile` configurations from the internet.

<br />

The [Layerfile library](/library) contains configurations that we've pre-created like `FROM webapp.io/node:18`.
It also lets you define your own shared configurations from scratch.

<br />

If your organization is called `my-org`, you could define `my-org/base:v1.0.0` to install the base dependencies for your organization, and then the Layerfiles in all of your repositories could use `FROM my-org/base:v1.0.0` to re-use build layers and configurations.
