# The EXPOSE WEBSITE instruction

`EXPOSE WEBSITE [location on runner] (path) (rewrite path)`

The `EXPOSE WEBSITE` instruction creates a persistent link to view a webserver running at a specific port in the Layerfile. It's especially useful for sharing changes with non-technical stakeholders or running manual QA/review.

Additionally, the `EXPOSE_WEBSITE_HOST` environment variable is available even before `EXPOSE WEBSITE` if you need to "bake" the path to the exposed website URL.

If the default 2 minute timeout is not sufficient for your application, use the following pattern to wait until the server is ready:
![expose website directive](/docs/resources/expose-website-directive.png)

### Examples

- Use `EXPOSE WEBSITE localhost:80` to expose the local webserver at port 80
- Combine `EXPOSE WEBSITE localhost:80 /api` with `EXPOSE WEBSITE localhost:3000 /` to route all requests that start with /api to port 80 in the runner, and all other requests to port 3000.
- Use `EXPOSE WEBSITE localhost:80 /cypress$SPLIT` after a `SPLIT 5` directive to make each split have a unique path (e.g., `z.cidemo.co/split1`)
